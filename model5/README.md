# Model 5 Implementation
Core architecture: **TF-IDF** embedding model with **Naive Bayes** classifier model
Author: *Marcus KWAN TH*

## Prerequisite (Same as Getting Started):
1. Cloned this GitHub repository into the local PC
2. Please run the following command to start playing with this project.

```bash
cd twitter-sentiment-analysis
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage: TF-IDF with Naive Bayes
1. Run `tfidf_nb_program.ipynb` from the current foler.
2. Follow the instruction inside the Jupyter Notebook to play around with it.

## Optional: TF-IDF Word-embedding Exporter
1. Run `tfidf_word-embed.ipynb` from the current foler.
2. Follow the instruction inside the Jupyter Notebook to play around with it.
